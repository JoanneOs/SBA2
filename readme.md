This project is a simple registration page designed to help us practice and better understand JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and form validation. 

We created a basic HTML structure with a form where users can input their username, email, and password. 

Using JavaScript, we added validation to check for:
empty fields
invalid email formats 
and short passwords

displaying friendly error messages when needed. 

Once the form is correctly filled out, a personalized welcome message appears.
